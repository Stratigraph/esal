Event Sequence Analysis Library
===============================


Esal ("easel") is a library for the statistical analysis and
manipulation of event sequences.  Esal is intended to be used for
exploring event sequence data and preparing data for modeling, but does
not do any modeling itself.  Conceptually, Esal is a representation for
a dataset of sequences and an associated set of meaningful operations
(selection, counting, transformation).

An event sequence is an ordered collection of symbols where each symbol
(event) can be associated with a time, duration, and value.
